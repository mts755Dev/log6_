## Design System

The platform uses a custom dark theme design system:

- **Colors:** Slate-based dark theme with blue primary accents
- **Typography:** DM Sans (body), Outfit (display), JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Components:** Professional, accessible UI components with hover states
- **Animations:** Subtle, purposeful animations using Framer Motion
- **No gradients** - Clean, professional aesthetic per requirements

## Data Persistence

Currently uses LocalStorage for demo purposes. The data layer is abstracted in:
- `src/services/storage.ts` - Generic storage operations
- `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` - Data access and mutations

This makes it easy to swap to a real backend (Supabase, Firebase, custom API) by updating the service layer.
